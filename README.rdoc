#Practice Tracker

I wanted to log my progress and keep the information in one place (and digital).
This is a Ruby on Rails app using Rails 4, HAML and Bootstrap.

The user is able to register a practice session, see previous sessions sorted by date and listed under instrumental group.
Then, they can add more specificity at the instrument level, for those who play more than one instrument, including exercises, etc.

Forthcoming
* More styling
* Sort options
* Goal tracking by instrument
